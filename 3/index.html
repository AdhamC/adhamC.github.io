            The average salary of a worker is about 35,000 Liras a month, about $40. Beef is 7000 Liras per Kg. Lamb is 8000 Liras per Kg. This renders red meat as a luxury the average
            worker cannot afford. Their entire salary is just about enough for 5 Kgs of meat per month total.

            People are only allowed 20 liters of petrol every other day. The government keeps track of that using a smart card system. There also is very little public transportation, and the
            limit on fuel cripples taxis who need much more petrol than that. This all results in the crippling of movement of people inside the city and between cities.

            The average salary of a worker is about 35,000 Liras a month. Gas cylinder used for cooking are about 8000 Liras. This, on top of the price of meat and vegetables, make
            food a significant cost in the life of a Syrin worker. Some people use electric stoves, but electricity is expensive and is not available for around 8 hours a day
            so that makes it a worse option.

            There is absolutely no freedom of expression in Syria. People live in constant fear of criticizing the government. Informants are absolutely everywhere and it is not
            always clear who is an informant. Criticizing the government can end people in jail for years, leading to them losing their jobs and retirement.
